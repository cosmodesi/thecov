# thecov

Code for estimating theoretical covariance matrices of power spectrum multipoles based on [CovaPT](https://github.com/JayWadekar/CovaPT/) by [Wadekar & Scoccimaro 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02914). Implements Gaussian + Trispectrum (from tree-level perturbation theory) + Super-sample (beat coupling + local averaging) terms in a cut sky.

Under active development. Code will be refactored and classes/functions will change.

TODO:
- Validate Trispectrum + SSC calculations
- Check against EZmock cutsky covariance
- Refactor code
